#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering - This is the systematic application of engineering techniques into the development of tools which are well designed into making of software systems which are reliable and able to adapt to future changes.

-- Importance in the technology industry

It Enables the Digital Transformation- Through the development of softwares system the problem are able to be solved in a more didgital way which in returns makes the tranformation easy 

Drives innovation - Through software development we are able to come up with new ideas each and everyday  and later into tangible products

Creates Economic growth - Having the innovation in place we are able to come up with new jobs which makes the economy to grow as each and everyday the future of a system is always demanding upgrades.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-- Milestones
Development of Programming languages different programming languages were developed such as C, COBOL Fortran
Establishment of software engineering as a displine in the 1960s - software Engineering was now recognized as a innovation which was good and okay for the entire people around
The widespread adoption and formalization of structured programming in the 1970s - having that codes might be challenging to go through people adopted the structured way, which is usually well written and easy to understand. It was made effective by having the iteration, Sequence and selection adopted in coding 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning stage - This is the phase to come up with a plan of what is being worked on and defining the problem and how to solve it .
2. Requirement analysis - This is involves the gathering and documenting the various requirement for the software.
3. Design stage - This involves the definition of system's components, interfaces and data structures, simply is the definition from what to how the software will function.
4. Implementation stage - After describing the how now at this stage is where the code is writting takes place to come up now witha functional software.
5. Testing stage - The verification of the software that is meets the requirement higlighted and it is bug free to ensure it is reliable and functions as intended
6. Deploment stage - This is the releasing of the software to the end-users which is done through various guides such as insstalling the software on servers, deploying it to app stores
7. Maintenance - Thiis is the last stage however it is usually ongoing after the deployment stage since it involves providing support, fixing bugs and updating the system as time goes by.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

--Waterfall Methodology - This is a software development method whereby each and every stage on the SDLC is checked and well discussed before proceeding to the next stage since in this method there is no going back it ensures maximum planning and documentation of a stage before proceeding to the other one. 
This methodology involves the limited customer Invovlement during development such projects includes Government projects such as building a Bridge, hospital system or a medical Device.

-- Agile methodology  - This is a software development method which is customer centered where the customer's perspective can be concidered on each and every stage of development. the risks are identified and addressed throughout the process which make the risk of fail less.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

--Project Manager - The role is to come up with plans, execution methods and monitoring of the software through the stages of development and even after development .
 Responsiblities
 Project Planning - Defining the project Scope, goals and timelines of the project.
 Risk management - Identifying and managing the project risks
 Schedule management - Tracking project progress and ensuring deadlines are met.
 

-- Software Developer - The role is to come up with the code, testing and maintaining it in order to form the software system
   Responsibilities
   Coding
   Design
   Testing 
   Debbing
   Maintenance and Collaboration

-- Quality Assurance Engineer - The role is to ensure the software meets Quality standards and is free of bugs
   Responsibilities
   Test Planning
   Test Execution
   Bug Reporting
   Perfomance Testing
   Usability Testing

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-- For IDEs they enhance individual developer productivity and code quality by packing aall required tools in our software application such as visual studio,
   They also Enhance project management by helping to organize code and manage files in complex projects.

-- For VCS they facilitate Team collaboration, code managemnt over time and version control. Since software is an innovation different times comes with diffent problem which requires improvement of the existing code which the VCS usually helps in tracking the version over times.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  

-- Rapid Technological Advancement 

Embrace continuous learning: Dedicate time for personal development, attend workshops, and explore online courses.  

Join communities: Participate in online forums, meetups, and conferences to stay updated.  

 
-- Lack of clear Requirements 

Define Project objectives, and goals before starting.  

Create clear documentation for the project's goals and expected outcomes.  

 
-- Time Constraints 

Effective time management: Prioritize tasks, set realistic deadlines, and avoid procrastination.  

 Agile sprints: Break down projects into smaller, manageable tasks.  

 Learn to improve skill in estimating time requirements for tasks. 

 
-- Software Testing Conflicts 

Promote open communication: Build a collaborative environment, and encourage communications between developers, and QA.  

Clearly define roles: Ensure each member of the development team has a clear understanding of their role, and responsibilities.  

Collaborative planning: create a collaborative testing plan. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-- Unit Testing
This involves the testing of individual components or modules of the software in isolation.
 Importance of unit testing
   1. Early detection of bugs at the code level
   2. Facilitates code refactoring by ensuring changes don't break existing functionality.
   3. Improves code quality and maintainability.
-- Intergration Testing
This is testing the interactions between different modules or components of the software.
 Importance of Intergration Testing
   1. Identifies interface defects and communication issues between modules.
   2. Ensures that the system as a whole functions as expected.
   3.  Verifies data flow and interaction between different parts of the application.
--  System Testing
This involves testing the complete, integrated system against specified requirements.
 Importance of system Testing
   1.  Evaluates the overall system behavior and performance.
   2.  Ensures that the system meets the user's needs and expectations.
   3.  Validates the system against the original requirements and specifications.
--Acceptance Testing
This is testing the system from the end-user's perspective to determine if it meets their needs and is ready for release.
 Importance of Acceptance Testing
   1.  Ensures that the system meets the business requirements and is usable in a real-world environment.
   2.  Provides confidence to stakeholders that the system is ready for deployment.
   3.  Validates the system from the user's viewpoint.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 -- Prompt engineering is figuring out how to give AI models the right instructions which are clear and specific in order to get the right answers you want.
  Importance of interacting with AI models
    1. Problem Solving and Innovation - Through give the instruction to AI problems are solved in a simple manner and this ensures that innovation is held all through
    2. 24/7 availability and reliability - Having that AI is apowered system this shows that the system is always available to the end- users
    3. Automation and Efficiency -  AI is able to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human workers which leads to increased efficiency and productivity in various industries.
  
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt -- Write about cars
Improved version -- Write a 3-paragraph article discussing the evolution of electric vehicle technology in the past decade, focusing on battery improvements and increased range.

For the vague prompt it wide and the output which will be given is not specific which is mostly likely not to be accurate to meet the intended results.
For the improved version it is concise and specific which will give the AI model a direct requirement of what it is required to do and how specific the output should be.
The improved version has given the type of cars which is in question, the specific timely and what exactly on the car is being discussed which is Battery improvement and the range.
